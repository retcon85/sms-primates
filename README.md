# Primates

Are you smarter than an ape?

Who amongst us can honestly say theyâ€™ve  never lain awake pondering the answer to this age-old question?

Well now you can find out, as you pit your wits against murderous primates armed with exploding bananas.
Use your knowledge of angles and projectile motion (don't forget to allow for wind conditions!) to plant a deadly banana in your opponent's furry face before he does the same to you.

Primates is a game for either 1 or 2 players. In 1 player you play against the CPU who may well be smarter than your average chimp.
Play heads up with a buddy, family member, colleague or lover in 2 player mode. Great for parties.
 
Inspired by the classic 90s BASIC game gorillas.bas [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillas_(video_game)], Primates gives this old format a fresh kick with a rapid fire "Arcade Mode". However for all those nostalgia nerds out there also bundled is a more sedate but no less difficult "Classic Mode" where all apes must politely follow Queensbury Rules and take it in turns to hurl incendiary fruits at each other.

(Note: there are a few known bugs left in the game, and a few omissions that I didn't quite get time to implement in time for the deadline, but hopefully I'll get round to fixing them soon but I hope people have fun with this game!)
